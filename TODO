Need to implement permission checking similar to the eKernel system. Reference permission handling as needed.
This is very simple working version of things.
Fixes:

TODO:
- Whitelist notifications.
- Administrative function notifcations.
- Administrator chat.
- Some command/chat features.
- Optimised code.
